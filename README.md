# REST API Coding Test
 ## Directions
  * Take the sample code below and add new API endpoints for products.
  * This challenge should take approximately 2 hrs.
  * Feel free to ask questions, comments within code are appreciated. 

**Each product has, at minimum, the following properties:**
  * id
  * name
  * cost
  * *three additional properties of your choice*
 
 ## Requirements
  * Should handle all basic CRUD functions.
  * Should include some sort of data source, be it in-memory or a database.
  * Include the SQL statements you would use for each function if the data source were an MSSQL database, but again, a database is not required.
  * Should include code comments as appropriate.
  * Should include a README.md explaining the following:
    * Explain any app architecture/design choices you made.
    * Explain any weaknesses or possible bugs you see in your code.
    * Explain how this sample API could be extended, modified, or maintained.

 **Note:**
  * There's no need to implement any login or security for this example, but feel free to explain how you would add security in your README.md (optional)
  * The directions are purposefully vague. Please feel free to describe any additional features or weaknesses in the sample code
  * that you feel would improve the final API. You don't need to implement these.
